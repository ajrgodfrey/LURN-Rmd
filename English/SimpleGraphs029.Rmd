## Scatter plot matrices {#ScatterPlotMatrices}

A scatter plot matrix is just a matrix of scatter plots where each
variable is plotted against all other variables. This graphic is
therefore very useful for a preliminary look at multivariate data. In R
, we obtain this graphic using the `pairs()` command as
illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:AirQuality-ScatterPlotMatrix).

Only four of the variables within the `air quality` data have
been used in this example because the variables for the month and day
take discrete values and therefore do not suit scatter plots — take a
look for yourself if you must but it’s probably better to think about
why this is the case before you look at the graphs. To select the four
variables of interest, I have created a `data.frame` with the
variables I want included; this `data.frame()` command is then
nested within the `pairs()` command.


```{r include=FALSE}
FigCap = "A scatter plot matrix for four variables found in the the Air Quality data."
```
