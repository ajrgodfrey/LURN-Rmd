So our experiment shows us that R is working in radians.

The functions `sin()` , `cos()` , and `tan()` give the sine, cosine, and tangent respectively. To find the inverse
sine, sometimes called the arcsine, we use the `asin()` command.
The hyperbolic functions associated with these functions also exist; use
`sinh()` , `cosh()` and `tanh()` and for the
inverse, just add an extra `a` before the command named here.
