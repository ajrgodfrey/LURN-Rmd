This chapter provides a brief explanation of how the
`BrailleR` package [@Rpkg-BrailleR] can be used by blind people to get
many tasks done quickly and effectively. In general, the package does
three things:

1.  creates a copy of the R console/terminal in a text file including    all standard output.

2.  creates text descriptions of some graphs. These tools should help    the blind user create graphs (with confidence) for the sighted world    we must work in.

3.  provides convenience functions for novice users who do not know    enough R commands to survive. Sighted people have the benefit of    graphical user interfaces (GUI) to help them, but none of them are    accessible by screen reading software.

Initially, the package was built on top of functionality I wrote to
support my own work practices, but additions to meet the needs of other
blind R users have been made on request.

A much more comprehensive user’s guide to the `BrailleR` package can be found at the [BrailleR in Action e-book homepage.](https://R-Resources.massey.ac.nz)

You will need to install the `BrailleR` package before
continuing on with the examples in this chapter. It is available from
CRAN. Use the examples in Chapter \@ref(Additional) to help install
this package. Then use the `library()` command to make sure the
package is ready for action.
