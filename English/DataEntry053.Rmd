Notice that as well as the result we wanted, R has also printed the
levels of the `Names` variable. This is because this variable
has been determined to be a factor.

## Appropriate data labelling

The construction of our first data.frame is slightly flawed. If the
`MyFirstDF` data was going to be for all those beings I am in
contact with, the details should be related to the individual concerned.
In this situation, allowing the `Names` object to be data
rather than a label was probably not the wisest move. Let’s say that we
want the year and month of birth for the individuals in the example, and
that they should form a new `data.frame`.
