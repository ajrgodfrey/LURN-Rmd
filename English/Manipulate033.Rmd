We can add more variables to sort the data by if we like. We used the
`desc` to get the temperatures to be in descending order in
this example.

The temperatures just listed are measured on the Fahrenheit scale. I
live in a country that uses the centigrade scale so a conversion is
needed to make these results more interpretable. Enter the
`mutate()` and `transmute()` commands.
