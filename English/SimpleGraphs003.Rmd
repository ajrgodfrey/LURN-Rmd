This chapter illustrates the construction of some basic exploratory data
analysis graphs. More complex graphs are considered in
Chapter \@ref(GraphsWithExtras), although at times we will see graphs
presented in conjunction with particular statistical analysis techniques
in other chapters. In this chapter, we concentrate on data taking
continuous values initially, but a short section on graphs for discrete
valued variables is also included.

There are many ways to create statistical graphs. The traditional method
uses one of the base R packages, but in recent years, the
`ggplot2` package [@Rpkg-ggplot2] has gained considerable attention. The
presentation of both styles of graph are given throughout this chapter.
You will need to ensure the `ggplot2` package is available for
use in your R session by issuing the command:
