This creates a text file called `JustPrintX.txt` in a subfolder called `other`, within the
current working directory (which I created earlier). The file is worth
looking at because it should show exactly what would have been printed
in the R window if the sink were not active. Note that the second use of
`sink()` stops the sink from being active.

Just typing the name of an object implicitly calls the relevant
`print()` function for that object type. This does not work when
a sink is active however, so we must use the `print()` command
explicitly to get the output into our sink file. For example
