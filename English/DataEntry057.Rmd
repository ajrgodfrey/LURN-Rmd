I’ve used a full printout of the resulting `data.frame` instead of using the `str()` command to show what R has created
because the `str()` command gives additional information that we
do not require at this point.

Let’s say we wish to add a new variable to this `data.frame`;
a task common when designing an experiment. We can use the $ notation
shown earlier in a new way. We add a set of eight random values
extracted from a standard normal distribution here as an illustration
using the `rnorm()` function.
