## Checking for stationarity {#Stationarity}

Stationarity is important for modelling time series. Some descriptive methods also
need it. The simplest form of stationarity is when the mean of the
series and the variance of the series both remain roughly constant over
time, or as explained by Hyndman and Athana-sopou-los (2013), "A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time
at which the series is observed". (their book is called Forecasting:
Principles and Practice.)

A white noise series of normally distributed data with mean zero and
constant variance $\sigma^2$ is the strongest form of stationarity we
seek in our modelling. It is the desired outcome for the residuals from
any model we fit to time series data.

The `Box.test()` function tests for non-stationarity.
