The `curve()` function has four arguments in this example. First
is the function being plotted, which in this case is `dnorm()` —the density function for the normal distribution. We then supply the
range of values over which this function is to be evaluated using two
arguments, and finally we ask that the curve be aded to the existing
plot. There are other arguments that we could add, including
`n` , the number of points to be evaluated over the specified
range.

The second example shown in Figure \@ref(fig:AddPolyCurve) below  is the addition of the quadratic fitted
line for a regression model. We use the example given in Section \@ref(PolyReg). 


```{r include=FALSE	}
FigCap = "The quadratic curve for the fitted values from a polynomial regression model added to the scatter plot of the data."
