So it seems the two variables are correlated and have a monotonic
relationship that implies that as wind speed increases the amount of ozone
decreases and that this relationship is fairly linear. We will look at
this relationship again when we look at linear regression in
Chapter \@ref(Regression).

## Testing the independence of two categorical variables

using the chisq.test command. Refer graphical representation to the
`vcd` package.

## Testing the normality of a distribution {#NormalityTests}

norm test package here.

We can use the `ks.test()` function for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test. It is suitable for comparing two samples, or a single sample
against a theoretical distribution, or the `shapiro.test()` function which is specifically for testing for normality.
