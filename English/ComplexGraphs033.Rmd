This provides a black and white image that has the contours marked with
the value of the third variable. A coloured version of the plot is
available using the `filled.contour()` command in place of the
`contour()` command in Figure \@ref(fig:MtEdenContour). An even
more impressive version of this plot can be obtained by looking at the
example that accompanies the help for the `volcano` data.
