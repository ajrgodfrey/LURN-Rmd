### Pie charts {#PieCharts}

OK, if you must do so, make a pie chart using the `pie()` command. Even the help for this command says they are a bad
representation for data, stating “Pie charts are a very bad way of
displaying information. The eye is good at judging linear measures and
bad at judging relative areas. A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable
way of displaying this type of data."

The pie chart for the `state.region` data is given in
Figure (fig:StateRegion-PieChart).

```{r include=FALSE}
FigCap="A pie chart showing which of the regions each of the fifty U.S.
states belongs"
```
