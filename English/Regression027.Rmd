Note that the `points()` command used here includes the
`col` argument to change the colour of the points to red — the
second colour in the list of colours.

Also note that there are missing values in the records for `Ozone`. The fitted values from the model are only calculated for the observations where `Ozone` was recorded, so we have
employed the `\!()` logical operator and `is.na()` command to include only complete cases for `Ozone` and
`Wind`.

Another solution that plots a curve instead of points, is demonstrated
in Section \@ref(AddCurves). It is much more elegant, especially
given the missing data problem encountered in this example.

## Multiple regression models{#MultipleRegressionModels}

The addition of multiple terms on the right hand side of the formula in
the `lm()` command is very simple. We can put both
`Wind` and `Temp` into a model as predictors using
