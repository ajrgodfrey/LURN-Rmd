The `stl()` command uses loess smoothing to estimate the
trend component before finding the seasonal components and the resulting
error terms, and is a slightly more advanced process than that offered
by `decompose()`. N.B. there is an `stl()` command in
the `stats` package and another in the `forecast` package. We use the simpler one here but need to force R to do so just
in case the `forecast` package version has precedence.
