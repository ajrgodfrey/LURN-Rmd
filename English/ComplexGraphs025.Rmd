## More complex bar charts

A bar chart, as seen in Section \@ref(BarCharts) , has a bar showing
the frequency of each level of a single factor. A cluster bar chart has
a bar for each combination of two factors. The clustering indicates how
the bars are grouped together. A stack bar chart on the other hand has a
single bar for each level of one factor split into sections for each
level of the second factor; it therefore appears to stack the bars on
top of one another.

To create an example, we will first create a list of frequencies of
outcomes and the two categorical variables required. The cluster bar
chart and stack bar chart then appear in
Figures \@ref(fig:ClusterBarChart) and \@ref(fig:StackBarChart)
respectively. Our data consist of the counts of males and females of
ages 17 to 20.
