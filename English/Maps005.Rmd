## Creation of maps

The creation of maps is actually a simple task in R , as long as the
database for the desired land mass is available. There are a number of
these data bases available as downloadable packages from CRAN.

I first created a map when I wanted a map of New Zealand (my home
country) for a presentation I gave when I was overseas. I also wanted to
show a portion of the country to highlight how far my home town is from
the nation’s capital. The rectangle that appears on the map of New
Zealand was created using the `polygon()` command. The
`box()` command places the frame around the map which is created
using the `map()` command. Figure \@ref(fig:WholeNZ) shows the
first map, while Figure \@ref(fig:PartNZ) shows the central part of the
country.

```{r include=FALSE}
FigCap="Map of New Zealand with a rectangle marked on it that bounds the area used in the map presented in Figure \\@ref(fig:PartNZ)."
```
