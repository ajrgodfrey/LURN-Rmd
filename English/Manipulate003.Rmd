This chapter explains how to rearrange your data to meet your needs.
Basic sorting, data extraction and re-combination are discussed.

To get the most of this chapter, you should have worked through
Chapter \@ref(DataEntry) on entering data manually. You do not need
to have completely read through Chapter \@ref(ImportingData) on importing
data as the examples here do not rely on its content. Ultimately, you
will want to use the material in Chapter \@ref(ImportingData) in
conjunction with what follows here.

This chapter starts using the functionality that is built into R , but
we also take a look at an add-on package called `dplyr` [@Rpkg-dplyr]that is becomeing more and more commonly used.

## Sorting the data into a different order {#DataSorting}

The `sort()` command is illustrated in this section. It works
for sorting a single vector of numeric values into ascending or
descending order.
