This comparative boxplot is created using a formula to describe the
relationship between the two variables that are referred to in our
graph. The use of the tilde symbol between `Wind` and `Month`  could be read as something like “average wind speed
depends on the month" — well a theory that might be illustrated in our
graph anyway. Certainly it is the potential for this relationship to
exist that may be exposed through use of the comparative boxplot.

### Dotplots

Dotplots aren’t everyone’s cup of tea but they are frequently offered as
substitutes for boxplots and histograms. Again, I chose to alter the
default window size for the example given in
Figure \@ref(fig:AirQuality-DotPlotWind) because I didn’t like the way the regular graph window presented this graph.


```{r include=FALSE}
FigCap="A dotplot showing the wind speed measurements."
```
