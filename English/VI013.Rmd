The full print out has everything we need but is not in a friendly
format. The `str()` command gives us a condensed version of the
data being stored but isn’t sufficient, and the `class()` command just tells us that this information is stored in an object of
type `histogram`. The class of the object is the most
important as it is what tells R how to work on the object when we use
the `plot()` command on the `MyHist` object. The `plot()` command is actually a family of commands, one of which
is purposely designed for histograms. The `plot.histogram()` command is actually what constructs the graph when the user calls the
`plot()` command on an object of type `histogram`.
This family of commands is known as a "method".

The `BrailleR` package includes a method for creating text
interpretations in a similar way. The `VI()` command is actually
a family of commands that includes the `VI.histogram()` command.
When we issue the `VI()` command on the `MyHist` object, the `VI.histogram()` function does the work. Let’s see what we get:
