Notice that I’ve changed the default orientation of the boxplot by
adding the argument `horizontal=TRUE` to the
`boxplot()` command. I have also ensured the more informative
axis label for wind speed is included using the `xlab` argument in the command.

### Comparative boxplots

Boxplots are often useful for comparing several small samples at once.
We must ensure that the same axis is used for the units of measure of
interest and the easiest way to ensure this is to put the various
samples into the same graphic with only one axis rather than having a
series of single boxplots each having their own axis.

For the purposes of illustration, I want to show the distribution of the
daily average wind speeds for the five months separately.

```{r include=FALSE}
FigCap="A comparative boxplot showing the wind speed measurements for each month."
```
