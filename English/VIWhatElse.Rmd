## What else?

Future developments in the `BrailleR` package will be made to meet demand.
If you do want some additional functionality that you think is likely to
be wanted by others then please do add to the wish list. Current ideas
on the wish list include:  - Easier to interpret multiple regression output.  - Easier to interpret principal component analysis output.  - More graph types being described using the `VI()` command.  - Easier to interpret factor analysis output.
