We could use other functions seen in this chapter for alternative
summary statistics within these functions. A common task is to check on
how much data we have for each group of interest. We could use
`summarise()` and `length()` to count up the data, but
the `dplyr` package gives us the `count()` function to
make this even more efficient.
