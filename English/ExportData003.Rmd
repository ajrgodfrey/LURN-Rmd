This chapter assumes you’ve got some data to export, and I mean data;
not results from analyses which is discussed in
Chapter \@ref(StoringResults). You may also wish to use this
information once you know how to tabulate various numerical summaries,
discussed in Chapter \@ref(NumericalEDA).

## Creating external files

This section is just the inverse action of importing data from an
external file as discussed in Chapter \@ref(ImportingData). All the
`read` type commands have corresponding `write` commands.

If you read Chapter \@ref(ImportingData) you’ll know that my preference
is to use files that are easily transferred and easily checked for their
accuracy using other software. In particular, I prefer to create comma
separated value (csv) files using the `write.csv()` command. If
there was a `data.frame` called `Chickens` in my
current workspace that I wanted to export for sharing with another user,
I would issue the following command.
