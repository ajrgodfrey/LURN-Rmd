## Time series plots

We have seen the flexibility of the `plot()` command in previous
chapters, and now we see another use. Applying the `plot()` command to a time series object generates a time series plot, as seen in
Figure \@ref(fig:NileTSPlot).

```{r include=FALSE}
FigCap="Time series plot for the annual flow of the River Nile."
```
