This chapter explains how various tasks in introductory calculus can be
undertaken using R.

## Creating mathematical expressions

Before we embark on doing those fun things we want to do, we need to
learn how to store a mathematical expression as an object in R. There
are many keywords that appear in these expressions which are translated
to symbols when seen printed in a graph window but remain in ordinary
text in R commands. Such symbols include Greek letters, hats and bars,
all of which have a meaning.

## Plotting functions

This can be a lot of fun if you set things up right to start with. We
create a `function` to represent the mathematical expression
using the `function()` command, then plot it using either the
`plot.function()` or `curve()` commands.
