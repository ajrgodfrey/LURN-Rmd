## Presenting the straight line modelâ€™s suitability in a graph {#AddFittedLine}

Adding a fitted line to the scatter plot when a simple relationship has
been fitted is actually a very simple task. Note that when we saw the
outcome of the simple model above, we obtained just the intercept and
slope coefficient values until we employed the `summary()` method to extract more useful information. These two values will be used by the `abline()` function to add the straight line to an
existing plot. See Figures \@ref(fig:AirQuality-OzoneWindWithLine) and \@ref(fig:AirQuality-OzoneTempWithLine) for example.
