The maps in these graphs are based on latitude and longitude data. The
`map()` function ensures the aspect ratio of the resulting plot
is in keeping with the actual view you would have from space if you were
directly above the centre of the map being plotted. Note that this rule
doesn’t apply for the world map options that exist.

## Adding cities to a map

The `map.cities()` function extracts data from a database of the
world’s cities. Judicious selection of the criteria for population was
required to get Palmerston North marked, and the `capitals` argument was used to get the point for Wellington. I have used some
colours to distinguish the different cities for my plot.
