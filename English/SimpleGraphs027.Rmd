The tilde symbol is often read as “…is distributed as…" but we might
simplify this to be read as “follows". This makes some sense as we
generally create a scatter plot to see if one variable follows the
other; in this case we are seeing if temperature depends on wind speed
in some way. I prefer this approach as it matches what we do when fitting a regression model, see Chapter \@ref(Regression) to see this demonstrated.


```{r include=FALSE}
FigCap = "A scatter plot showing temperature on the y axis and wind speed on the x axis."
```
