You can use any valid mathematical expression in the
`function` you create. You might find it useful to test your
idea= values for your inputs that are easy to work with, such as zero
and one. You could then use integers, including negative integers, but
it could be easier to test your functions using values that lead to
identifiable results such as multiples of $\pi$ when working with
trigonometric functions. For example:
