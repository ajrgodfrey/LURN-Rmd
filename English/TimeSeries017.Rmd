Each test is looking at a different facet of what might indicate how a
series might not be stationary. Check out the null hypothesis and
alternative for each test on its help page.

## Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation

The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function values can be
obtained using the `acf()` and `pacf()` commands.
Plotting these is a common way to determine if any of the values found
are of interest in understanding the process being modelled so this is
the default action performed by these commands. See
Figure \@ref(fig:NileACF) for the plot generated by the `acf()` command. The `pacf()` command functions in the same way so is
not demonstrated.
