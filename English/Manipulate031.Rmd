This way of presenting commands is considered to be easier to read by
many users which helps with the popularity of the `dplyr` package. The pipe operator comes from another package called
`magrittr` so its use is not limited to the commands found in
the `dplyr` package. This way of presenting multiple commands
is called “chaining" in many resources. I like the simplicity that this
offers so I have tried to use the pipe operator as often as I can from
here on.

The `filter()` command is useful if we know the values a
variable takes, but at times we just want to know more about the
observations that are best or worst according to one (or more)
variables. For example, if we wanted to find the hottest days, we can
use the `arrange()` command instead of the `order()` command seen earlier.
