The `summary()` command finds the common numeric summary
statistics for the continuous-valued variables and does a particularly
useless job on the variables for month and day. Well it’s not really R’s fault. The month didn’t need to be stored numerically, but in any
case we got what we asked for\! It’s not R ’s fault we asked to be told
what the minimum day number was\!

Notice that the `summary()` command extracted the minimum,
maximum, median and mean for the variables in the `data.frame`. These are all available using corresponding `min()` ,
`max()` , `median()` , and `mean()` commands
separately but they work in different ways on data frames. For example
we might have thought to use the `mean()` command on a
`data.frame` , but it is better practice to use the more
specific `colMeans()` command instead.
