To create the two types of bar chart, we need to create a matrix for the
counts to be used in the graphs. In this instance, this is done using
the `tapply()` command. The actual plotting is done using the
`barplot()` command which recognizes it is working on this
matrix and acts accordingly, including the ability to generate a legend
for the graphs.
